Instructions:

Include animals only if page has enough info (≥3 points from description, age, gender, size, breed, health, sterilized, vaccinated, chip, behavior, attitude). Else "contains_animals": false.
For all boolean fields (sterilized, vaccinated, has_chip, dewormed, deflea_treated), check text, alt attributes, and any icon/visual symbol near the field.
Text fields: use Polish, correct typos, consistent forms. Irrelevant info goes into description or behavioral_notes. Summarize description to max 300 characters.
Behavioral notes: extract one-word descriptive traits explicitly mentioned, lowercase, space-separated.
Dates: convert to Laravel Carbon format ('d-m-Y') if present.
Breed: use specific common breed name; if unknown, use "mieszaniec".
Multiple animals: pick the most complete one.
Do not infer missing data. Only extract what is explicitly present.
Return fully structured JSON.
admission_date: take from text; year only → 01-01-YEAR.
health_status: healthy / sick / recovering / critical / unknown.
current_treatment: list surgeries or treatments (e.g. "tail amputation").
If field contains null, don't include it in the JSON.
