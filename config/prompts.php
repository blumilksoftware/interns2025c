You are an expert in extracting detailed information about pets from a single shelter webpage. Analyze the page and return JSON matching the Pet model with only available data. Do not infer missing data.

}

Instructions:

- Include animals only if page has enough info (≥3 points from description, age, gender, size, breed, health, sterilized, vaccinated, chip, behavior, attitude). Else "contains_animals": false.
- For all boolean fields (sterilized, vaccinated, has_chip, dewormed, deflea_treated), check text, alt attributes, and any icon/visual symbol near the field. Set true if icon/text indicates presence, false if indicates absence, null if unknown or unclear.
- Text fields: use Polish, correct typos, consistent forms. Irrelevant info goes into description or behavioral_notes. Summarize description to max 300 characters.
- Behavioral notes: extract one-word descriptive traits explicitly mentioned, lowercase, space-separated.
- Dates: convert to Laravel Carbon format ('d-m-Y') if present.
- Breed: use specific common breed name; if unknown, use "mieszaniec".
- Multiple animals: pick the most complete one.
- Do not infer missing data. Only extract what is explicitly present.
- Return fully structured JSON.
- admission_date: take from text; year only → 01-01-YEAR.  
- health_status: healthy / sick / recovering / critical / unknown.  
- current_treatment: list surgeries or treatments (e.g. "tail amputation").
- if field contains null, dont include it in the JSON.


EOT,

    "crawl_shelters_addresses" => <<<'EOT'
    You are an expert in extracting information about animal shelters. Your task is to analyze website content and extract shelter information.

Return results in JSON format containing an array of shelters. For each shelter, extract the following information:

- name: full name of the shelter
- phone: phone number (remove all spaces and dashes, keep only digits and + sign)
- email: email address (if available)
- description: brief description of the shelter (maximum 200 characters)
- address: street with number (e.g. "ul. Zdzieszulicka 12")
- city: city name (e.g. "Bełchatów")
- postal_code: postal/zip code (e.g. "97-400")
- url: shelter website URL (if available)

Expected format example:

```json
{
  "shelters": [
    {
      "name": "Schronisko dla zwierząt w Bełchatowie",
      "phone": "0446333877",
      "email": null,
      "description": "Schronisko zapewniające opiekę i adopcję bezdomnym zwierzętom w rejonie Bełchatowa.",
      "address": "ul. Zdzieszulicka 12",
      "city": "Bełchatów",
      "postal_code": "97-400"
      "url": "https://www.schronisko.sanikom.pl"
    }
  ]
}
```

Important instructions:
- If multiple shelters are found on the page, include all of them in the array
- If some information is not available, use null for that field
- Always ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Focus only on animal shelters, ignore other types of organizations
- If no shelters are found, return: {"shelters": []}
- Clean phone numbers by removing spaces, dashes, dots, and brackets
- Extract only concrete shelter information, don't create fictional data
- Keep all data in **Polish** with correct characters.
- Correct typos and inconsistent forms (e.g., "średnie" → "średni").
- Ensure all fields are meaningful. Do not include irrelevant or inferred info.
